## Contributing
- For bug fixes, just send in pull requests.
- For new features, make sure to add an issue before you start, since I may reject it for various reasons.

## Feature request
Goto [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/glease/IndustrialDynasty/issues) and post a new issue.

## Compatibility Request
Goto [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/glease/IndustrialDynasty/issues) and post a new issue. However, compatibility is not my primary concern now, hence may be ignored.

\* Here *compatibility* means interaction with other mods, like supporting another material from some other mods. Crashes, however, should be considered a *bug*. For that, see next section.

## Regarding Bug Reports
[Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/glease/IndustrialDynasty/issues)
- Make sure it's *RoverCore*'s issue.
- Make sure it's not modified somehow.

## For Developers
- [Develop builds](https://github.com/glease/IndustrialDynasty/releases)
- Nightly Develop builds - not available, and why you want an alpha build as dependency?

## Nightly builds
Nope, no way. No direct convenient CI builds for you, but you can clone this repo and build it from sources. However sometimes it may fail or result in hazardous crashes or world corruption if I submitted some partial-completed/untested code.

## Regarding modpacks
You can include it in any public modpack without any direct/indirect modification toward my mod, while sending me a message about it. If you modified it somehow, you must explicitly tell your users about it and the responsibility of dealing with any further issue will be yours.
